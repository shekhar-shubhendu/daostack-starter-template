# DAOstack Starter Template

This is a basic template you can use for kickstarting your project using the DAOstack platform.
Here you can find the basic structure for using Arc to build your project.

# How to get started:

First, please change the `package.json` file to fit your project.
You can then go ahead and edit the template to fit your needs.

## Project Structure:

In this template, we use: `npm`, `truffle` and `webpack`, as well as DAOstack Arc, Client and Subgraph.
The structure is basically as follows:

- **contracts** - Your custom smart contracts should be located under here. You can use any Arc contract simply by importing it. This is an example import `import "@daostack/arc/contracts/universalSchemes/UniversalScheme.sol"`
- **migrations** - This is a truffle migration scripts folder. You can write Truffle migration script for deploying your DAO or smart contracts and place the script under that folder. We already created a file for you to deploy a new DAO using @daostack/migration library.
- **starter-app** - This folder is initialized with React App which uses DAOstack client library `@daostack/client` to interact with contracts and the subgraph. These will be your Dapp front-end files. In development environment we have a `webpack` server running which looks for the changes made in `starter-app/src` folder and compiles them into client side JS files. You can can find the starting file `App.js` which you can use for your project.
- **subgraph** - This is based on graphprotocol and uses mappings defined in `src/mappings` to index the blockchain events and store them in a `postgres` database as Entities described by `graphQl` schema. The `subgraph` deploy script uses output of migrations in `data/migration.json` to get the contract addresses. You can find mappings for the base contracts here and can add more mappings and schema for your custom contracts
-**data** - This folder contains the `testDaoSpec.json`, which is file used to specify details for the new DAO to be deployed, feel free to change it according to your project needs. It also contains an `example.env`, which has example environment variables set, copy this file to your project root i.e. `starter-template` folder as `.env` and edit the variables accordingly. Lastly, there is a `migration.json` file which will contain the output after running the migration

## How to customize your DAO?
 In order to customize your DAO you will modify `data/testDAOspec.json`, which has the DAO specifications.
 ```
  {
    // Name of your DAO, Native token and Native token symbol
    "orgName": "DevTest",
    "tokenName": "Dev",
    "tokenSymbol": "DEV",

    // Whether you want to use universal controller or deploy your own controller
    // Read more about controlers in Arc repo
    "useUController": false,

    // DaoCreater lets you bundle up tx to deploy Avatar, Reputation and Token contract
    // and upto 100 founder member intitialization in single tx. You can have more founders
    // and there will upto 100 batched in another tx and so on.
    // It also bundle up the tx to register scheme
    "useDaoCreator": true,
    
    // Select the schemes you want to register to your DAO and the votingMachine params
    // to use with the scheme.
    // Note if no params mentioned, then it defaults to using params VotingMachinesParams[0]
    "schemes": {
      "ContributionReward": true,
      "GenericScheme": false,
      "SchemeRegistrar": true,
      "GlobalConstraintRegistrar": false,
      "UpgradeScheme": false
    }
    "ContributionReward": {
    },
    "SchemeRegistrar": {
        "voteRegisterParams": 0,
        "voteRemoveParams": 0
    },
    "VotingMachinesParams": [
      {
        // Voting ratio required for instantly passing a proposal
        "queuedVoteRequiredPercentage": 50,

        // How long non-boosted proposal stays open 
        "queuedVotePeriodLimit": 432000,

        // How long boosted proposal stays open
        "boostedVotePeriodLimit": 86400,

        // How long proposal is open for predicting before it is boosted
        "preBoostedVotePeriodLimit": 43200,

        // Controls how quickly the boosting threshold goes up. Larger => fewer boosted proposals
        "thresholdConst": 1200,

        // Time added if there is a last minute flip in the DAO’s decision on boosted proposal
        "quietEndingPeriod": 14400,

        // Rep awarded to proposer
        "proposingRepReward": 500,

        // Voters voting on un-boosted proposal gain/loose this amount based on the outcome
        "votersReputationLossRatio": 1,

        // Amount automatically staked by DAO against the proposal. This incentivise pridictions
        "minimumDaoBounty": 150,

        // Auto Down-stake size
        "daoBountyConst": 10,

        // Time after which DAO will start accepting proposals
        "activationTime": 0,

        // If set allows only the following address to vote on behalf
        "voteOnBehalf": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
      }
    ],

    // founder members
    "founders": [
      {
        "address": "0x90F8bf6A479f320ead074411a4B0e7944Ea8c9C1",
        "reputation": 250,
        "tokens": 2000
      },
    ],
  }
 ```

## Running your project on private network:

### Using docker
After downloading the project and docker:

- Update the `.env` file with your `PRIVATE_KEY`  `PROVIDER` and `NETWORK` in `starter-template` directory. Use `data/example.env` for reference
- Update the `.env` file in `starter-template/subgraph` directory. Use `subgraph/example.env` or `subgraph/readme.md` for reference
- Enter the project folder from the terminal (i.e. starter-template) and type the following:

  ```
  npm run launch:docker
  npm run logs:graph
  ```

  This would build the docker images and start the docker container for `ganache`, `starter-app` with webpack server, `graph-node` for indexing blockchain events, `ipfs` where subgraph mappings reside and `postgres` database where blockchain events are stored as described by the schema

- Wait for the logs screen to say *Starting JSON-RPC admin server at: ....*, then you can either exit the logs or in a different terminal window type

  ```
  npm run migrate
  npm run logs:ganache
  ```

  Make sure the DAO is deployed and output is written to output file. You should see the following in the ganache logs:
  ```
  { name: 'DevTest',
  Avatar: '0xE7A2C59e134ee81D4035Ae6DB2254f79308e334f',

  ✔ Wrote results to data/migration.json.
  eth_getBlockByHash
  eth_getTransactionReceipt
  eth_getBlockByNumber
  ...
  ```

  Exit the logs and from the project directory i.e. `starter-template` type:

  ```
  npm run deploy-graph
  ```

  This will deploy the subgraph and if you are still following the graph-node logs you can see it syncing the blockchain events

- Open your web browser and type *http://localhost:3000/* This is your react Dapp. You can edit the `starter-app` code to modify frontend and the webpack watcher will rebuild the app

- In another browser window/tab type *http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/<subgraph_name_from_example.env>/graphql* or *http://localhost:8000/* This is an interface to the subgraph and you can type graphQL queries here to fetch data from the `postgres` database

_To learn more about subgraphs check out: [DAOstack Subgraph](https://github.com/daostack/subgraph), [TheGraph Project](https://thegraph.com/docs/quick-start)_

### Deploy and use on test network:

- Update the `.env` file with your `PRIVATE_KEY`  `PROVIDER` and `NETWORK` in `starter-template` directory. Use `data/example.env` for reference
- Update the `.env` file in `starter-template/subgraph` directory. Use `subgraph/example.env` or `subgraph/readme.md` for reference
- Open terminal at the project folder and run the following commands:

  ```
  npm i
  npm run migrate
  ```
  

  You should see following output:

  ```

  ```

  To launch the development environment (react app and subgraph) for testnet DAO, You will have to make appropriate changes in following files:

  **docker-compose-testnet.yml**
    - update ethereum url in graph-node service to testnet url eg `rinkeby:https://rinkeby.infura.io/<INFURA-KEY>`

  **App.js**
    - add `settings.<TESTNET>` eg. `settings.rinkeby` with `web3Provider` set to testnet url
    - initialize Arc with `settings.<TESTNET>` eg. `settings.rinkeby`

### Stop the project:
- From the project directory type:

  ```
  npm run stop
  ```

#### Using MetaMask with ganache:
  - Open metamask and import using private key
  - You can find the private keys from ganache logs by running `docker container logs starter-template_ganache_1`
